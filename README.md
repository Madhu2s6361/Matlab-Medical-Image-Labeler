# Matlab-Medical-Image-Labeler
MATLAB Medical Image Labeler is a specialized app within MATLAB’s Image Processing and Computer Vision toolboxes used to manually and semi-automatically annotate medical images and volumes. It is widely used in medical imaging, radiology AI, and clinical research to prepare ground-truth datasets for machine learning and deep learning models.

# Medical image labeler app in the (Matlab) helps you to annotate (label) medical image 
---> it can train, validate, test using any models 

---> task like detection,segmentation,classification 

---> Kinds of labeling are:
